It is more beneficial to concatenate arrays instead. This little helper achieves just that. Consider the example below:\n\n```javascript\nvar merge = require('webpack-merge');\n\nvar common = {\n  entry: [path.join(ROOT_PATH, 'app/main.jsx')],\n  ...\n  module: {\n    loaders: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.css$/,\n        loaders: ['style', 'css'],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n};\n\nif(TARGET === 'build') {\n  module.exports = merge(common, {\n    module: {\n      // loaders will get concatenated!\n      loaders: [\n        {\n          test: /\\.jsx?$/,\n          loader: 'babel?stage=1',\n          include: path.join(ROOT_PATH, 'app'),\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n    ...\n  });\n}\n\n...\n```\n\nCheck out [SurviveJS - Webpack and React](http://survivejs.com/) to dig deeper into the topic.\n\n## License\n\nwebpack-merge is available under MIT.
